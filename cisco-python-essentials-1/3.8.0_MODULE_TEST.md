1. An operator able to check whether two values are equal is coded as:
- [ ] `===`
- [ ] `=`
- [ ] `==`
- [ ] `!=`

<details>
  <summary>Check</summary>

  - Answer: `==`
  - Reason: Remember that the **==** operator compares two arguments and **checks if they are equal**.
</details>

2. The value eventually assigned to x is equal to:

```python
x = 1
x = x == x

```

- [ ] `1`
- [ ] `True`
- [ ] `0`
- [ ] `False`

<details>
  <summary>Check</summary>

  - Answers: `True`
  - Reason: The **==** operator is more prominent in the operator hierarchy than the **=** operator. Therefore, the operation on the right is evaluated before the one on the left.
