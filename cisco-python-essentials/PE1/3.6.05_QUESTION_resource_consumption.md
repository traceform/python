```python
my_list = [17, 3, 11, 5, 1, 9, 7, 15, 13]
largest = my_list[0]

for i in range(1, len(my_list)):
    if my_list[i] > largest:
        largest = my_list[i]

print(largest)
```

The concept is rather simple ‒ we temporarily assume that the first element is the largest one, and check the hypothesis against all the remaining elements in the list.

The code outputs `17` (as expected).

The code may be rewritten to make use of the newly introduced form of the `for` loop:

```python
my_list = [17, 3, 11, 5, 1, 9, 7, 15, 13]
largest = my_list[0]

for i in my_list:
    if i > largest:
        largest = i

print(largest)

```

The program above performs one unnecessary comparison, when the first element is compared with itself, but this isn't a problem at all.

The code outputs `17`, too (nothing unusual).

If you need to save computer power, you can use a slice:

```python
my_list = [17, 3, 11, 5, 1, 9, 7, 15, 13]
largest = my_list[0]

for i in my_list[1:]:
    if i > largest:
        largest = i

print(largest)
``````

The question is: which of these two actions consumes more computer resources ‒ just one comparison, or slicing almost all of a list's elements?

> [!NOTE]- My Answer:
> Doing one comparison more consumes slightly less resources than making an entirely new slice because doing so forces Python to allocate memory for each element in the new slice, consuming more CPU and memory.
