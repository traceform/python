## Scenario

Your task is to prepare a simple code able to evaluate the **end time** of a period of time, given as a number of minutes (it could be arbitrarily large). The start time is given as a pair of hours (0..23) and minutes (0..59). The result has to be printed to the console.

For example, if an event starts at **12:17** and lasts **59 minutes**, it will end at **13:16**.

Don't worry about any imperfections in your code ‒ it's okay if it accepts an invalid time ‒ the most important thing is that the code produces valid results for valid input data.

Test your code carefully. Hint: using the `%` operator may be the key to success.

  

# Test Data

**Sample input:**

```
12
17
59
```

**Expected output:**

```Output
13:16
```

**Sample input:**

```
23
58
642
```

**Expected output:**

```Output
10:40
```

**Sample input:**

```
01
29
39
```

**Expected output:**

```Output
1:0
```

## Code:
```python
hour = int(input("Starting time (hours): "))
mins = int(input("Starting time (minutes): "))
dura = int(input("Event duration (minutes): "))

# Write your code here.

```

  ```python
  hour = int(input("Starting time (hours): "))
  mins = int(input("Starting time (minutes): "))
  dura = int(input("Event duration (minutes): "))
  # find a total of all minutes
  # find a number of hours hidden in minutes and update the hour
  # correct minutes to fall in the (0..59) range
  # correct hours to fall in the (0..23) range
  print(hour, ":", mins, sep='')
  
  ```

  <summary>Sample Solution</summary>

  ```python
  hour = int(input("Starting time (hours): "))
  mins = int(input("Starting time (minutes): "))
  dura = int(input("Event duration (minutes): "))
  mins = mins + dura # find a total of all minutes
  hour = hour + mins // 60 # find a number of hours hidden in minutes and update the hour
  mins = mins % 60 # correct minutes to fall in the (0..59) range
  hour = hour % 24 # correct hours to fall in the (0..23) range
  print(hour, ":", mins, sep='')
  ```
