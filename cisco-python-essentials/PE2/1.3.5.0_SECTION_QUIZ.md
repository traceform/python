**Question 2:** Some additional and necessary packages are stored inside the <code>D:\Python\Project\Modules</code> directory. Write a code ensuring that the directory is traversed by Python in order to find all requested modules.

```
import sys

# note the double backslashes!
sys.path.append("D:\\Python\\Project\\Modules")

```

Assuming that <code>D:\Python\Project\Modules</code> has been successfully appended to the `sys.path` list, write an import directive letting you use all the `mymodule` entities.
