3.2.10   **LAB**   The _continue_ statement – the Ugly Vowel Eater

---

## Scenario

The `continue` statement is used to skip the current block and move ahead to the next iteration, without executing the statements inside the loop.

It can be used with both the while and for loops.

Your task here is very special: you must design a vowel eater! Write a program that uses:

- a `for` loop;
- the concept of conditional execution (_if-elif-else_)
- the `continue` statement.

Your program must:

- ask the user to enter a word;
- use **`user_word = user_word.upper()`** to convert the word entered by the user to upper case; we'll talk about **string methods** and the `upper()` method very soon – don't worry;
- use conditional execution and the `continue` statement to "eat" the following vowels _A_, _E_, _I_, _O_, _U_ from the inputted word;
- print the uneaten letters to the screen, each one of them on a separate line.

Test your program with the data we've provided for you.

  

## Test data:

**Sample input:**

```
Gregory
```

**Expected output:**

```Output
GRGRY
```

**Sample input:**

```
abstemious
```

**Expected output:**

```Output
BSTMS
```

**Sample input:**

```Output
IOUEA
```

**Expected output:**

```Output

```

## Code:
```python
# Prompt the user to enter a word
# and assign it to the user_word variable.

for letter in user_word:
    # Complete the body of the for loop.

```
