1. ```python
    if '__name__' == '__main__':
        print("This script shouldn't be run directly!")
        exit()
    ```
    - This is wrong because `__name__` is a variable.
    - Is it needed to import `sys.exit()` here? What's the difference?
2. ```python
    import sys

    sys.path.append("D:\\Python\\Project\\Modules")
    ```

3. ```import abc.def.mymodule```
