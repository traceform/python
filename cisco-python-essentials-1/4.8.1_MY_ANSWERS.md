21. Select the **true** statements about the _try-except_ block in relation to the following example. (Select **two** answers.)

```python
try:
    # Some code is here...
except:
    # Some code is here...

```

- [ ] If there is a syntax error in code located in the `try` block, the `except` branch will **not** handle it, and a _SyntaxError_ exception will be raised instead.
- [x] If you suspect that a snippet may raise an exception, you should place it in the `try` block.
- [x] The code that follows the `except` statement will be executed if the code in the `try` clause runs into an error.
