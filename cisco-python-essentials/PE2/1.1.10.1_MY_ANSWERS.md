1. `mint.make_money()` because the whole module has been imported
2. `make_money()` because only the `make_money` entity has been imported
3. `from mint import make_money as mk_money` (the alias can be anything) because this way the remote `make_money` entity is not going to clash with my function.
4. `make_money()` because all `mint` entities have eben imported, however this is not recommended as it may eventually clash with local entity names
